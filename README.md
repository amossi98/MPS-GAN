# MPS-GAN

**A Matrix Product State (MPS) Framework for Simultaneous Classification and Generation**

MPS-GAN is a research-focused project that implements a quantum-inspired Matrix Product State model capable of both classifying data and generating new samples. By leveraging a novel GAN-style training approach, the model improves generative performance while maintaining robust classification accuracy.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Matrix Product State model as described in the [masterâ€™s thesis](docs/thesis.pdf). The model:
- Uses tensor networks for data representation and processing.
- Implements advanced embedding functions (e.g., Fourier and Legendre embeddings).
- Trains with both standard cross-entropy loss for classification and adversarial loss in a GAN-style setup for generation.
- Provides an exact sampling method to generate data from non-normalized MPS outputs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MPS-GAN.git
cd MPS-GAN


2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # For Linux/MacOS
env\Scripts\activate # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Training the Model:
To train the MPS model for classification:
python src/training/train_classification.py --config config/classification.yaml


### GAN-Style Training:
To perform adversarial training:
python src/training/train_gan.py --config config/gan.yaml


### Sampling New Data:
To generate new samples from a trained model:
python src/sampling/sample.py --model_path path/to/model.pt --num_samples 100


## Results

Results and analysis, including visualizations of generated samples and evaluation metrics, can be found in the `experiments/` directory. Refer to the thesis for detailed explanations and experimental setups.
